This is a script for kOS that can autonomously land a rocket.

Video of this in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v85HOATx4M

Script is tuned for this ship: https://kerbalx.com/crafts/12044

To use, download land.ks and land_lib.ks and in your KSP directory put them under Ships/Script. Download the ship file and put it in the Ships folder of your save.

Open the kOS terminal of the control system part above the RCS tank, and type "switch to 0." then "run land." Click away from the terminal and press "1". The rocket should launch.
